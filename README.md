# mdmcba-maven-plugin

This plugin can be used to build and package CBA application created during MDM project creation in IBM MDM Workbench. The plugin does not replace the need to generate the Manifest.MF in CBA project. Keeping the correct and valid Manifest still lies with the developers. This plugin just aids creating the CBA artifact that can be deployed in WebSphere Application Server and attached to MDM EBA. You can install this plugin in your local maven repository or publish to your internal maven repository like Nexus or Artifactory etc. Once this is available to your build machine, you can mavenise your CBA project, add your MDM projects maven artifacts as the dependency in pom.xml and use custom packaging (cba).

A sample project is available [here](https://github.com/geramit/plugin-test). This is using artifacts available publically which need ti be replaced by your own MDM artifacts.
